# Who Follows My Friends? 

In this short exercise, I wanted to explore the popularity of the people/organizations (users) I follow on Twitter. 
Since I joined Twitter back in 2009, it has evolved tremendously and I imagine people use it differently--I know I do. 
When I first joined, I only followed friends and some famous names. Since then, however, Twitter for me has become less of a way to connect with friends, but more of an information channel where I follow more famous names than people I personally know. 

Along this vein, I wanted to explore how popular are the users that I follow? Are the majority of them companies or celebrities that have millions of followers? Have the people I know personally grown to have large followerships? 

I follow about 110 users on Twitter, but capturing the followership of all 100+ users would be tedious on the Twitter API (https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/accounts-and-users/follow-search-get-users/api-reference/get-followers-ids; http://docs.tweepy.org/en/v3.5.0/) and cumbersome to plot on Gephi (https://gephi.org/).
