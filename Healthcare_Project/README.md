**Update:** The final repo for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/vasudhathinks/survival_prediction_mimic) and its associated [app, here](http://survival-prediction.herokuapp.com/index). 

This directory contains two (2) sub-directories/folders that contain information and analysis of some MIMIC-III Healthcare data as part of the Project Proposal to do while at The Data Incubator. Each sub-directory has its own README that explains its contents.
