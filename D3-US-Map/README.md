# Which States in the US have I visited?
A new year's resolution I made back in 2013 was to try and visit as many states
as possible in the US. It's been 5 years since then, so I wanted to gauge 
how much progress I've made. As opposed to statistics, I thought it would be
more interesting and fun to *visualize* the states I've visited.

Thus, I created a D3 map that shows which states I have visited and which are
still on the bucket list.

*The next iteration of this exercise will include cities I've visited.*
